# Implementation-of-Bluetooth-Communication-System

My Project of the Digital and Wireless Communications Course Offered in Fall 2021 @ Zewail City.

In this project, I implemented the implement the Bluetooth-Communication-System using MATLAB and LabView.

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances (up to 10 meters) using UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs). 

The modulation type for the first applied Bluetooth technology in version 1 was Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK), but with the requirement for higher data rates two forms of phase shift keying were introduced for Bluetooth 2 to provide the Enhanced Data Rate Capability.

## System Specifications:
      
        A) Modulation Technique: π/4 DQPSK, 8-DPSK
        B) Frequency Band: 2.402 GHz – 2.48 GHz
        C) Bit Rates: 2 Mbps, 3 Mbps
        D) Transmission Bandwidth: 1 MHz

## Implementation Steps:

            1) Simulating the Bluetooth Communication System especially for the modulation and demodulation parts (π/4 DQPSK, 8-DPSK) using MATLAB and LabView.
            2) Plotting the constellation of the healthy signal and the noisy signals in both MATLAB and LabView.
            3) Transmitting an audio signal using the system.
